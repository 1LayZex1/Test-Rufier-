This application will allow you to diagnose your health.
The Rufier test is a load complex designed to assess the performance of the heart during exercise.
For the subject and who is in the application lying on his back for 5 minutes, determines the pulse rate in 15 seconds.
Then, within 45 seconds, the subjects perform 30 squats.
After the end of the load, the subject lies down, and the number of pulsations is again counted for the first 15 seconds.
And then the last 15 seconds. The first minutes of the recovery period.
Important! If during the test the watch and yourself feel dizzy,
tinnitus and more, then the test should be interrupted and see a doctor.
